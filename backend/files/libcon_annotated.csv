That equals about 20% less EU GDP and tax. With about 20% more EU costs of welfare, pensions etc. The EU has no way out. The issue is how much of this disaster can it hide. It is now heading below 10% of global trade. While Asia will soon be over 50%. In which the UK is well placed to prosper. The UK must get more free from EU control and influence.

TE13_881;telegraph;cons;british;broadsh;When I started out in work in 1981, it was fun, exciting and as an entrepreneur you could reap the rewards. By 2001, red tape had made being in business a lot less fun, and considerably less rewarding. Instead of driving my business. I was spending too much of my time managing staff. By 2012, I knew I didn?t want to have staff anymore as it had become too onerous as an employer. Their rights and whims outstripped the potential rewards from running a business, but all the risks of owning a business remained. There is not an environment for taking a chance, risking your capital, and your health, because running a business is a lot of hard work. So many people now feel they are owed a living and have no loyalty to an employer who is taking all the risk, often putting their house on the line.

At the same time, by refusing to borrow to invest, the accelerator & multiplier effects that Keynes quantified that powered the New Deal are not coming into play. Meanwhile the cost of living crisis continues, hollowed out public services are operating extremely inefficiently and the queue for NHS treatment means vast numbers of people are stranded out of being able to work. Which brings me to brexit. Sooner or later Starmer is going to be forced to recognise that The EU isn't going to agree to The UK cherrypicking all the advantages of the EU without shouldering all the burdens it has too. He is also going to get desperate as the next election approaches and zero growth impact has been delivered to voters. So, how could he persuade brexit voting communities to change their minds? Firstly the demographics overwhelmingly favour Rejoin as old brexit voters did off and young Rejoiners reach voting age. Secondly there is a widespread perception that Vote Leave won by lies and deception, in which The right wing media player a crucial part. Why? The mania for brexit was created for one overarching reason. The EU had begun to organise to end the arrangements that allowed overseas tax havens to operate with EU economies, many of them British crown territories. Faced with this, the owners of so much of the British media decided enough was enough and they wouldn't ""go gently into that good night"". EU regulation was bad enough, but to have the mechanism that allowed them, their families and allies to offshore their wealth beyond the reach of taxation to be scrapped had to be resisted. It was this motivation that drove the right towards brexit whilst corporate Britain was solidly Remain. Boris Johnson 's years as the telegraph's Brussels correspondent, busy inventing suitably incendiary lies by the yard about banning sausages, regulating the shape of bananas or that millions of Turks would flood into the UK, exemplifies just how far right wing newspapers went to demonize the EU: they ""raged against the dying of the (taxhaven) light"". Labour must cut the legs from under these purveyors of fake news. Their attempt to use brexit to turn this country into their wet dream offshore tax haven for the feral rich failed. Now's the time to turn the tide and go on the offensive. All those offshore British sovereign territories that provide the lion's share of the world's tax havens are ripe for a clampdown by the UK government. It's time they can no longer be allowed to be plugged into the world's banking and investment networks, hiding vast wealth from scrutiny and enabling huge tax evasion & avoidance. Wealth equal to $7-10 Tn is squirreled away there, avoiding $100-250 Bn pa of tax revenue. Indeed London is itself a form of tax haven for the mega rich, who use the offshore havens to hold luxury houses and other assets via shell companies registered in them. Londonograd is the bolt hole for oligarchs to spirit their ill gotten assets out of Russia. How can the UK printed press be regarded as free when 80% - at least - is owned, controlled and operated by offshore billionaires who do not pay tax in the UK and who use it to propagate their own anti-democratic views? Labour must resurrect the final stage of the Leveson Inquiry and consider whether a clampdown on overseas ownership of these influential media should be curtailed. Going after billionaire tax evasion is going to be very popular and takes the fight to those bankrolling and supporting Reform and the trussite Tory right. Britain is uniquely positioned to work with the EU on this issue. Those who sowed the seeds of brexit must now reap the whirlwind of ending their ability to hide their wealth offshore and pay zero tax.";155;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;

GU1_148;guardian;liberal;british;broadsheet;"The recent statement by Keir Starmer opposing UK membership of the ERASMUS+ programme is a double whammy and utterly self-defeating. ERASMUS+ is open to non-EU member states and six such states are full members (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Serbia, Turkiye and North Macedonia) with a large number of other states associated with elements of the programme. Particularly noteworthy is Norway, which has twice rejected EU membership in referenda but has never interpreted that vote as a refusal to engage in cooperation with its neighbours. But the second element of Starmer's rejection of ERASMUS+ is that he is doing so on behalf of the UK government, which ONLY has responsibility for education and training in England. Under the UK state's supposedly ""permanent devolution settlement"", the devolved governments in Scotland, Cymru-Wales and N. Ireland are responsible for education and training in their areas and under previous ERASMUS+ programmes played a role in stimulating participation through their support for universities, colleges, schools and training programmes. Scotland in particular was the biggest per capita participant in ERASMUS+, due not just to enthusiastic internationalism (as shown in the Brexit vote) but also the fact that the Scottish education system is distinctly different to the rest of the UK and modelled very much on European lines, particularly the 6 years of secondary schooling and 4 years of university undergraduate degrees (unlike the 7+3, or rather 5+2+3, unique model in rest of UK). This makes for greater synchronisation with European partners. N. Ireland's Assembly and the Scottish Parliament also have devolved responsibility for their legal system as well as education. In the case of Scotland, the separateness of Scottish legal and education systems is enshrined in the Acts of Union of 1707, a constitutional settlement that Starmer claims to respect and defend. So it comes as a significant constitutional jarring that the European Commission will only accept the UK government legal underpinning as a participant ""country"" in the ERASMUS+ programme. No doubt this Commission rejection of UK nations participating in the ERASMUS+ programme came on the back of a need to secure the Windsor Agreement/NI Protocol with the UK government, and probably also not upsetting other EU states formed of more than one national entity. But it's in contradiction with the ""variable geometry"" of the EU in accepting member states can have territories with a different relationship with EU rules and regulations (eg French Guyana is a full participant in the EU despite being in South America; the Faroe Islands is part of Denmark buty not part of the EU, has just been accepted into the Horizon research programme but has chosen NOT to to be in ERASMUS+ though as all Faroese can have EU passports; previously Gibraltar also had a different relationship to other dependent territories of the UK such as Jersey; Aland Islands ... etc etc). The government of the Republic of Ireland EU member state has budgeted millions of Euros to provide participation in ERASMUS+ for anyone living in the territory of N. Ireland following UK departure and their right to do this is accepted by the European Commission and UK government. So the question is: since Starmer claims to want to ""reset"" relations with both the UK devolved parliaments/governments and with the EU, has he consulted with the Scottish and Welsh government ministers responsible for education and training about his veto of them joining ERASMUS+? And if not, why does he think the UK government with responsibility only for England on this matter within the UK state, has the right to veto an important aspect of devolved government education and training policy - because the European Commission lets him get away with it?";55;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;

Regarding 'hating Britain', notwithstanding the red lines that Theresa May drew up which boxed the UK into a very tight corner and closed many doors, Michele Barnier is quite sympathetic towards her in the book, and laments that she spent more time having to deal with those in her own party whose interests were more related to their own fortunes than the benefit of the UK.

It is interesting how major issues like this are seen in a totally different light in other countries. Brexit is, actually, not the main issue from a European viewpoint, certainly from what I read of the French, Belgium, and Spanish press. EU countries simply do not trust the UK, as simple as that. Brexit was simply the culmination of decades of the UK insisting on exemptions, most of which on social laws which are one of the bedrocks of the EU, and the constant noise in the UK's successive governments depicting the EU as the stupid despotic enemy. The UK was treating the EU as a ""business club"" which they could not totally dominate, whereas the EU has, from its inception, be a ""social integration"" movement to avoid another World War starting on the European continent. The business element came later, followed by infrastructure, etc, etc. So Brexit was just the drop too many and, put simply, there are now two, if not three generations of people in the EU who do not want the UK back in the EU. It gets worse, on top of the Tories mismanaging the finances of this country, a burning topic at the moment, they did not even keep their side of the Brexit separation agreement, so while Starmer's Labour government is making noises about a ""reset"", the EU is pushing back with ""Please, fully fulfil your side of the Brexit agreement before we start talking about ""reset"" - we weren't able to ever trust you fully for 43 years, we were proved right, if you want a ""reset"", let's talk about you at least sticking to your side of the Brexit separation agreement"".

I do wish they'd pull their necks in, at least for Labour's first year in office.;46;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;
GU2_441;guardian;liberal;british;broadsheet;Studies of right wing populism, on both sides of the Atlantic, reveal that its supporters represent the least educated sections of the electorate. They reveal too that right wing populism is the most likely source of that misinformation. Put these two together and add a third factor, the rise of technology and the ease of disseminating misinformation through social media and you have the recipe for the simultaneous rise of populism which Mr.Behr describes. The answer then, lies in a highly effective state education system which ensures that all sections of the electorate are equally informed. Following 14 years of deliberate neglect our own state education has been severely curtailed and it is the poorest sections of society which suffer the most as a result. Throughout that same period our private schools have continued to thrive, many maintaining their reputation as the best in the world, but they are exclusive, the domain of the wealthy. To attend Eton, the school which has produced so many of our conservative leaders, now costs almost ?60 000 a year. While such an unequal system remains our unrepresentative politics will perpetuate with only occasional lapses into what we have now, although even that has been shown to be increasingly obeisant to wealth and the right wing trend. The most effective way to break this glaring injustice is not to disenfranchise the private schools but to incorporate them into the state sector, providing every pupil with equal opportunities and simultaneously educating the entire electorate, flooding it with knowledge, fact and truth instead of the blinding misinformation and conspiracy theories which are presently threatening to further destabilise our already dangerously fractured world.;46;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;
